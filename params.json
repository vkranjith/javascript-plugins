It's still under development phase and I know there are many form validation plugins out there. But with this plugin I wish to provide the maximum flexibility. This plugin outputs an object with all the validation error messages which can be used with any other third-party plugins (like jquery modal) to display the error messages.\r\n\r\n## Developer\r\nHi! My name is VK Ranjith. For more info about me please visit http://vkranjith.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
